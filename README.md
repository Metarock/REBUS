Assests that were updated

Enemy object:
- Fixed an issue when the game is played, the camera follows the enemy characters as well. 

THINGS TO BE ADDED/NOTED:
- Enemy script needs to have a collision code so that enemy doesn't bug into the map walls.
- More enemy sprite to help differentiate enemy and player 
- More testing units
